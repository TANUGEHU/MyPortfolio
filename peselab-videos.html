          <h2>LAB 1</h2>
          <p>In today's lab, ma'am observed our gestures, postures, and personalities. At first, she seemed strict, but once she started speaking, I was impressed—especially by her diverse academic background. She also shared some stories, which made the session more engaging. She has a personality that fills everyone with enthusiasm,creates a motivated and positive learning environment—exactly the kind of personality every career skills teacher should possess. 
            Towards the end, we played a really interesting game called Chinese Whisper. She made us stand in a queue, then whispered a phrase to the first person. Each of us had to pass it along to the next, and by the time it reached the last person, the phrase had completely changed!</p>
