          <h2>LAB 1</h2>
          <p>In today's lab, ma'am observed our gestures, postures, and personalities. At first, she seemed strict, but once she started speaking, I was impressed—especially by her diverse academic background. She also shared some stories, which made the session more engaging. She has a personality that fills everyone with enthusiasm,creates a motivated and positive learning environment—exactly the kind of personality every career skills teacher should possess. 
            Towards the end, we played a really interesting game called Chinese Whisper. She made us stand in a queue, then whispered a phrase to the first person. Each of us had to pass it along to the next, and by the time it reached the last person, the phrase had completely changed!</p>

          <p>In this session, we focused on professional communication and body language. Ma'am demonstrated various postures and gestures that convey different messages in a professional setting.

          <p>Today's lab was all about group dynamics and teamwork. We were divided into teams and given various challenges to solve together. The activities required us to communicate effectively, delegate tasks, and work towards a common goal. It was interesting to see how different people took on different roles within the team.</p>

          <p>In our final lab session, we combined all the skills we learned through a comprehensive role-play exercise. We simulated a professional workplace scenario where we had to handle various situations like client meetings, team conflicts, and project presentations.
